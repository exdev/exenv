	This version do appear to be flaky. I've looked over the code, my guess is a bug in the thread handling, the cure is simple:
	Please tear out everything concerning threading. Nothing calls for a thread here, no gains at all. No use.

	Yes, I can confirm the problem.
	Sometimes a file is not extracted (without notice) and if a file with same filename exists in the destination directory it is deleted !

	There is a bug not only in decompression as some guys report here, but also in compression!

	Sometimes I get archives that seem to contain all files I entered, the SHIFT+ALT+F9 reports "okay", but - *all* files in the archive cannot be decompressed...

	Sorry Adam, you need to improve you plug-in *soon*!!! Meanwhile I will use the old external 7z plugin...

	Great job. It is definitely much faster than previous version (which depended on external 7za.exe) . Progress bar also finally works.

	!!WORNING!! This plugin have a huge bug when you unpack archive packed oryginal standalone 7zip 4.32 & maybe previosly version too, not always but most of the time don`t unpack all files, many time just miss files without any worn/errors. This hapend on all systems xp/2000/98 & other and all file systems like fat/32/ntfs this is not a joke check this because you can lose many importand data when you pack oryginal but unpack by tcm every unpack you lose next files....
